# Ride Booking App – Case Study Submission

This project is a simple ride booking system built using React for the Tech Pioneer Program 2025. It is a frontend-only prototype to simulate how users can book a ride and track its status.

---

# What it Does

- A user can log in with their name (mock login)
- They can request a ride by entering pickup and drop-off locations and selecting a ride type (Car, Bike, Rickshaw)
- After requesting, a simulated driver sees the request and can accept or reject it
- If accepted, the ride goes through different status updates: Requested → Accepted → In Progress → Completed
- Completed or rejected rides are shown in ride history

---

# Technologies Used

- React (JavaScript)
- HTML/CSS (basic)
- State is used to simulate data (no backend or real database)
